When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

	When you want many other people to work on your project
	or when you might be using more than one system for
	your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

	Because some commits might make the project more buggy
	and it's not the final version of the project. We may
	want to put things public when the project makes some
	sense.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are cloning on the github servers whereas you
	can clone from github to local machine or local to 
	local machine. When we want to work on someone else's
	project, first we will fork it. If the changes aren't
	small, we will clone the project on our machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?

    To keep a track of how many extra commits we have made
    since we last synced with the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What
would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Collaboration using GitHub will be easier. Without
    GitHub we would have to manually copy paste all the
    changes after discussing with the contributor in 
    person.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch
rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each
approach have?

    We make changes in separate branch when we intend to
    share it with someone else or the change is something
    an entirely different feature.
