When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

	When you want many other people to work on your project
	or when you might be using more than one system for
	your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

	Because some commits might make the project more buggy
	and it's not the final version of the project. We may
	want to put things public when the project makes some
	sense.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are cloning on the github servers whereas you
	can clone from github to local machine or local to 
	local machine. When we want to work on someone else's
	project, first we will fork it. If the changes aren't
	small, we will clone the project on our machine.
