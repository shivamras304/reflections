When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

  When you want many other people to work on your project
  or when you might be using more than one system for your
  project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

	Because some commits might make the project more buggy
	and it's not the final version of the project. We may
	want to put things public when the project makes some
	sense.
